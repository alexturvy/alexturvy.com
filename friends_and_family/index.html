        <h1 class="ffc-section-title">Why This Version Exists</h1>
        <p>This is a version of my dissertation written for the people I care about — the ones who've asked me, patiently, what my research is about, who've listened to half-explained tangents about TikTok or Instagram or platform affordances, and who maybe aren't in the habit of reading academic work for fun.</p>
        <p>It's not simplified. It's clarified. The big ideas are still here — about creativity, structure, culture, and power — but they're delivered in a way that respects your time and invites you in.</p>
        <p>This project uses memes to explore how social media platforms really work — not just what features they offer, but how they shape what people make, how they're seen, and who gets to be heard. It's about TikTok and Instagram, yes — but also about the systems quietly shaping online culture.</p>
        <p>The cartoon on this page captures something familiar: even when you're trying to be clear, it's easy to forget what other people <em>don't already know</em>. This document is my attempt to remember that — and to offer an explanation that makes sense, even if you've never used the word "meme" in a sentence with "cultural production." This is the version I hope you'll actually enjoy reading.</p>
