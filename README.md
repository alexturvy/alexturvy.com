# Alex Turvy, PhD

**Media Sociologist | UX Researcher | Platform Studies**

Welcome! This repository accompanies [alexturvy.com](https://alexturvy.com), the professional site of Dr. Alex Turvy. I am both a UX researcher in the EdTech sector and a sociologist publishing academic work on digital culture, platform governance, and creative labor. My work specializes in how digital platforms shape—and are shaped by—cultural participation, creative labor, and everyday social practices.

## About Me

I study how people socialize on TikTok and Instagram, with a focus on how platform design, governance, and algorithmic systems structure what users can see, do, and become. My work bridges academic research and applied UX, bringing mixed-methods approaches to both scholarly and industry contexts.

## Research Interests & Methodologies

- **Mixed Methods:** Discourse analysis, digital ethnography, policy analysis, platform walkthroughs, and computational methods (R, Python).
- **Triangulation:** I combine qualitative insight and quantitative structure to study digital culture, platform governance, and user experience.
- **Key Themes:** Memes, subcultural aesthetics, humor, and the creative ways users stretch platform boundaries.
